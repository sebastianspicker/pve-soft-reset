# Reference Snapshot: quasi-vanilla Proxmox VE host

This file is intentionally a compact snapshot, not executable logic.

## Baseline Principle

Vanilla host means packages and repos from Debian + Proxmox (optionally Ceph).
Third-party detection in `pve-soft-reset.sh` is based on APT origin metadata.

## Typical Signals

- APT sources are limited to Debian/Proxmox (plus optional Ceph).
- Running services are mostly standard PVE services.
- `/opt/*` and `/usr/local/bin/*` are often empty or minimal on vanilla nodes.

## Usage

Use this as a human reference when interpreting audit output.
For exact behavior, rely on the script and CLI docs.
